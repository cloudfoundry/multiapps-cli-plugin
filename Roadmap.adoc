# Project multiapps roadmap highlights

## Outlook

### Features:
  - dependencies between services (credential/service keys sharing between orchestrated service instances) 
  - deploy namespaces (same mta, multiple instances within a space)
  - explicit modelling for service keys (currently only modelled as part of a service instance creation/update)

### CF features / covering multiapps ocrhestration gaps on the CF Api:
  - rolling deployment for both deploy/bg-deploy scenario (deployment resource) 
  - service sharing
  - route services
  - modelling CF metadata 
  - support for host-less routes

### Other:
  - adoption of cf v.7 cli
  - d-s discovery via the service broker api
  - mta-id based cli interface (instead of process-id)
  - blue-green deploy keeping original app names
  - additional performance improvements (via caching of hashes, skipping operations)
  - loggregator v2 api support  
  - autoscaling on high load (> 300 deploys/hour)
  - repository with multiapps examples on github.com

### Features:
  - ‘hooks’ functionality, allowing to execute cf tasks on apps in different moments during deployment. Allows for orchestration of e.g. graceful shutdown or any on-update activities – e.g. triggering update of dependent tenant aware services. 
  - partial deploy - ability to process only selected parts of the mta
  - many improvements toward deployment configuration (parameters) handling
  - configurable restart on app environment change
  - signature checking for deployed content
  - IDE editor support for the descriptors in VSCode & InteliJ (via static schemastore.org validation & auto-complete)
  - additional parallelization, after parallel app deployment was done – for service instnances and app deletion in bg-deploy scenarios.
  - configurable persistent state of service bindings / env vars / routes - merging existing deployment’s with the targeted’s

### Adopted CF features / covering orchestration gaps of our on the CF Api:
  - adoption of the CC V3 api           
  - buildpacks (plural) support
  - reuse default domain value from CC

### mics 
  - new https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool[cloud mta build tool] - OSS tool for buld & assembly of MTA archives! 
  

### Stability/resilience/performance improvements:
  - automatic retry of deployments on certain types of failure
  - handling backing service state during deployment e.g. last operation ‘in progress‘
  - support for up-to 4GB deployables
  - regularly executed load & stress tests
  - azure object store persistence       
  - rate limiting
